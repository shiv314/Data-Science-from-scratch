In fact, when we’re dealing with a sample from a larger population, x_bar is only an estimate of the actual mean, which means that on average (x_i - x_bar) ** 2 is an underestimate of x_i’s squared deviation from the mean, which is why we divide by n-1 instead of n. The main premise here is that we tend to overestimate the actual mean of the sample from the true population and thereby underestimating the sum of squared values of the deviations."
